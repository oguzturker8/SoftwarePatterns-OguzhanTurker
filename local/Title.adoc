Asciidoctor is a fast, open source text processor and publishing toolchain for converting AsciiDoc content to HTML5, DocBook, PDF, and other formats. Asciidoctor is written in Ruby and runs on all major operating systems. The Asciidoctor project is hosted on GitHub.

To simplify installation, Asciidoctor is packaged and distributed as a RubyGem (aka gem) to RubyGems.org. Itâ€™s also distributed as a package for popular Linux distributions and macOS. In addition to running on Ruby, Asciidoctor can be executed on a JVM using AsciidoctorJ or in any JavaScript environment (including the browser) using Asciidoctor.js.

=== AsciiDoc Processing
Asciidoctor reads and parses text written in the AsciiDoc syntax, then feeds the parse tree to a set of built-in converters to produce HTML5, DocBook 5, and man(ual) page output. You have the option of using your own converter or loading Tilt-supported templates to customize the generated output or produce additional formats.

Asciidoctor is a drop-in replacement for its predecessor, AsciiDoc Python (asciidoc.py). The Asciidoctor test suite has > 2,350 tests to ensure compatibility with the AsciiDoc syntax.

In addition to the classic AsciiDoc syntax, Asciidoctor recognizes additional markup and formatting options, such as font-based icons (e.g., icon:fire[]) and UI elements (e.g., button:[Save]). Asciidoctor also offers a modern, responsive theme based on Foundation to style the HTML5 output.
